# AIS_Project

This program consists of several tests that will run to show the performance of a variety of methods that do certain operations on the provided database. For a top level document describing methods that are present and what they do, navigate to "documentation docs/build/html/DAO.html". 

To run this program, (all commands made in cmd.exe on windows. Mac syntax is similar)

1) Download the zip file.
2) Extract the folder into a location of your choice.
3) Open an instance of your mysql server in the terminal (mysql -u{username} -p).
4) Create a new database titled "project_database" (CREATE DATABASE project_database).
5) Quit out of mysql ("\q").
6) cd to the location you extracted the zip folder.
7) In the terminal, type the following "mysql -u {your username} -p project_database < project_database.mysql".
8) Once the database finishes deploying, run the "final_project.py" file in python terminal (python.exe final_project.py).
9) Error statements will print, showing method exceptions that we have checked for.
10) See that all 32 tests pass!
