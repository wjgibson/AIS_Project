# AIS_Project

All priority 1 methods are/are very nearly implemented. Tests are being finshed for delete() and vessel_info(). Work should be done on priority 2 methods.

As all of these are read methods, we can follow the same setup as in previous read methods. Declare the query with a select statement, trim it with list comprehension, and return the result. Testing for these can be done one the integration (testing a result returns from the database itself) and the interface (allowing it to fail nicely if incorrect parameters are passed)

All methods should be commented with documentation on their functions and return values. A top level doc will also need to be made for the entire project that explains it's overall funcionalities, how to run it, etc.
